    <h1>Violet Evergarden (ヴァイオレット・エヴァーガーデン)</h1>
    <h2><em>Plot</em></h2>
    <p>The story revolves around Auto Memory Dolls (自動手記人形, Jidō Shuki Ningyō): people initially employed by a scientist named Dr. Orland to assist his blind wife Mollie in writing her novels, and later hired by other people who needed their services. In the present time, the term refers to the industry of writing for others. The story follows Violet Evergarden's journey of reintegrating back into society after the war is over and her search for her life's purpose now that she is no longer a soldier in order to understand the last words her mentor and guardian, Major Gilbert, had told her: "I love you."</p>
    <h2><em><strong>Main characters</strong></em></h2>
    <p>Violet is a newcomer to the CH Postal Company, and works as an Auto Memory Doll—a ghostwriter for people who cannot write or are looking for help expressing their emotions in letters.
        As an abandoned and nameless child, Violet was found by navy officer Dietfried Bougainvillea on an island where he and several members of his crew were forced to land after a naval engagement. Her combat prowess was discovered when she killed several soldiers who attempted to molest her before he could stop them. Violet then stalked and killed all the other crew members. For reasons he did not understand, Violet spared Dietfried and obeyed his orders. Later, Dietfried brought Violet home and "gave" her to his brother Gilbert in the military as a gift for his promotion to major, intending for Gilbert to use her as a "tool" for war while not wanting to handle Violet himself. Gilbert instead treated her as a human, taught her how to speak, read, and write, and named her Violet, wishing she could grow up to be as beautiful as the flower. During the war, she repeatedly played a vital role in battles. Trying to save Gilbert in the war's decisive battle, she lost both her arms. With the war over, her arms were replaced with advanced metallic prosthetics, and she decided to become an Auto Memory Doll to learn the meaning of the words "I love you" (愛してる, Aishiteru)—Gilbert's last words to her before they became unconscious in the battlefield.
